# Interpreter In Go

This repo will hold my progress in reading and following along to the book writing an interpreter in go. This is to learn more about lower level programming and is a interesting dive into the behind the scenes of running code.

#### Why Go
A big strength of go is the simplicity of the language. This is something which is mentioned multiple times online, it makes the language easy to pick up and understand even for somebody with not too much familiarity with the language. I also personally enjoy the language because it is easy to write while still getting the control you get with other system's programming languages
